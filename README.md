# File Sorter
**This is a python project that helps me on a daily basis.**

When executed, it <ins>automatically</ins> organizes random files in my folder to different folders by categories.

The types of filters I want to sort are **".xlsx", ".JPG", ".pdf", and ".docx"**. 

A timer that calculated seconds until 12pm was included to execute the task every noon of the day.
